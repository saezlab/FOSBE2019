# This function evaluates the effects of possible feeder mechanisms which could potentially
# bee added to the PKN. A case study is model is build by binding feeder mechanisms with a
# subset of the original PKN linking all the cues set which have an influence over a specific
# measurement over which we are doing the evaluation and their corresponding directly linked
# measurements. A mechanism is only accepted if the overall fit of that measurement is improved
# by considering the feeder mechanism which we add and evaluate and which at the same time does
# not worsen the fit of the other measurements included in the case model within a specific 
# tolerance parameter.

# Inputs:
# Mandatory:  A cnolist object containing the data (cnolist)
#             A model to optimize (model)
#             A feeder object as returned by buildFeederObjectDynamic.R function
